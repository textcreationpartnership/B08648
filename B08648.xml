            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head type="sub">Humbly Repreſented to the Right Honourable the LORDS Spiritual and Temporal in Parliament Aſſembled.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>S<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſannah Smith,</hi> born in <hi>London</hi> of <hi>Engliſh Parents,</hi> but now an Inhabitant of <hi>Suratt,</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> was at Fourteen Years of Age married on the <hi>16th</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> 1680. according to the Rites and Ceremonies of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to <hi>Henry Smith,</hi> Accomptant to the Honourable the <hi>Eaſt India</hi> Company, in the Iſland of <hi>Bombay,</hi> where ſhe then lived, and afterwards cohabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with him as his Wife, till the <hi>27th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> 1684. at which Time the aforeſaid <hi>Henry</hi> was ſent over into <hi>England</hi> by Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <hi>Child,</hi> for ſome ill Practices there, and left the ſaid <hi>Suſannah</hi> his Wife, big with Child, which died quickly after its Birth.</p>
            <p>At the Time of his Departure from <hi>India,</hi> the ſaid <hi>Henry</hi> took not the leaſt Care for the Maintenance of his ſaid Wife, nor has he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſince ſent for her over into <hi>England</hi> to him, or return'd her any money for her ſupport: And ſince the Year 1687. has neither writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to her, or given her the leaſt Information of himſelf or his Concerns.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1690. the aforeſaid <hi>Henry Smith</hi> did in the Church of <hi>Dukes-Place, London,</hi> joyn himſelf in a pretended Marriage with one <hi>Suſannah Wycher,</hi> by whom he has had ſeveral Children, and with whom he ſtill cohabits as his Wife.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Suſannah Smith</hi> having certain Information of the ſaid pretended Marriage, did on the <hi>19th</hi> Day of <hi>February</hi> laſt paſt, inſtitute by her Proxy a Cauſe of Divorce, by Reaſon of <hi>Adultery,</hi> againſt the ſaid <hi>Henry Smith,</hi> in the Court of the Right Reverend Father in God, <hi>Henry</hi> Lord Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> in which Court, upon full Proof of the Premiſes, ſhe did, on the <hi>18th</hi> Day of <hi>June</hi> following, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a Sentence of Divorce from the aforeſaid <hi>Henry Smith;</hi> and accordingly now remains Divorced without any Appeal by him inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</p>
            <p>Whereupon the aforeſaid <hi>Suſannah Smith,</hi> doth moſt Humbly Requeſt, That a Bill may paſs this moſt Honourable Houſe for the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and Indempnifying her from all Pains, Penalties, &amp;c. which ſhe or her Iſſue may incur, in caſe ſhe ſhould happen to Contract Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with any perſon, not otherwiſe by Law prohibited, during the Life-time of the aforeſaid <hi>Henry Smith.</hi>
            </p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Reaſons Humbly Offered for the Paſſing the ſaid Bill.</head>
               <p n="1">I. Having conſulted ſeveral very Eminent and Learned Divines, ſhe has been aſſured by them, That there is nothing in the Law of God prohibiting a Second Marriage, the Lawfulneſs whereof, as they inform her, has been univerſally allowed by all Foreign Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants ſince the Reformation.</p>
               <p n="2">II. She has been informed by her Council Learned in the Laws of this Realm, that the Statute <hi>Primo Jacohi,</hi> prohibiting Second Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages during each others Life, has a particular Exception as to Perſons Legally divorc'd: And likewiſe, That the High Court of Parliament has paſs'd Acts in Favour of ſuch Second Marriages.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Having adviſed with Perſons skill'd in the Civil Law, they tell her, that ſuch Marriages have been all along allowed by that Law, under Emperours that were Chriſtians.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. As to the Canon Law, She hath likewiſe been informed, that till the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> (which was never received even by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts themſelves on this ſide the <hi>Alps</hi>) thoſe Canons which have been made againſt ſuch Marriages, have been generally <hi>Advice</hi> and <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,</hi> rather than <hi>Expreſs Prohibitions.</hi> And that the Canon of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is not Declaratory of any Unlawfulneſs in ſuch Second marriages, but only prohibits them upon Penalty of a Bond given at the time of paſſing the Sentence of Divorce. And likewiſe, That a book, called, <hi>Reformatio Legum Eccleſiaſticarum,</hi> appointed to be made by Authority of Parliament, in the Reign of K. <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th,</hi> and actually compiled by the moſt Learned Perſons in all Profeſſions, in the Time of K. <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>6th,</hi> doth in the Title contern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Divorces, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. give leave to the innocent perſon, Divorced by reaſon of <hi>Adultery,</hi> to marry again, affirming, That ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marriage is allowed by our Saviour. <hi>Cum alter Conjux Adulterii damnatus eſt, alteri licebit innocenti novum ad Matrimonium, ſi volet, progredi. Nec enim uſ<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>

                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> adeo debet integra perſona crimine alieno premi, celibatus ut invite poſſit obtrudi: Quapropter integra perſona non habebitur Adultera, ſi no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vo ſe matrimonio devinxerit, quoniam ipſe Cauſam Adulterii Chriſtus excepit.</hi> And indeed the Reaſon not only of this, but of all Laws, ſeems to forbid, the Compelling of an innocent perſon to ſuffer for another's Offence.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Beſides theſe General Reaſons, ſhe humbly conceives there are ſome peculiar and proper to her ſelf, which may not happen on any other Occaſions. <hi>As,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Her Age,</hi> which was but Fourteen at her marriage, and Eighteen when her Husband left her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Length of Time</hi> ſince ſhe has been deſerted, which has been Twelve Years. And ſhe is inform'd, That it is the General Opinion of Foreign Divines, That a Re-marriage is lawful, after a Deſertion of a much ſhorter continuance, and particularly as to <hi>her own Countrey.</hi> That the foremention'd book, in the <hi>Title of Divorces, Chap.</hi> 9. does allow of it after <hi>Three Years Abſence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Cruelty of ſuch Deſertion,</hi> leaving her among <hi>Infidels,</hi> big with Child, without money, and taking no care for her Relief afterwards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His Second Marriage,</hi> by which his Life is Forfeited to the Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His having ſeveral Children by that Second Marriage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Impoſſibility of any Reconciliation to be made between him and her,</hi> not only on account of <hi>Cruelty, Deſertion</hi> and <hi>Adultery,</hi> but of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Wife and Children, which he ought to maintain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Her having no Iſſue by him,</hi> who might otherwiſe be prejudiced by her Re-marriage.</p>
               <p>And Laſtly, <hi>There being no Alimony aſſign'd her by the Sentence of Divorce:</hi> So that ſhe can have no proſpect of any maintenance from him for ever.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, <hi>She Humbly hopes, That in conſideration of the Premiſes (which are ſuch in this Caſe as may never probably happen in another,) This Most Honourable Houſe will be pleaſed to Relieve her, by paſſing the Bill ſhe now moſt humbly Offers to their Lordſhips.</hi>
